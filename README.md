# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.


# Problem Statement
Visualize the distribution of the variables in the [Heart-Failure-Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) dataset and explore their relationship with the target variable DEATH_EVENT. 
Based on the result of this analysis, I define seven machine learning models to compare their performance on this dataset to predict the target variable using the most correlated subset of variables from the dataset.
